\page faq Frequently Asked Questions

\li: Q: I am puzzled, shogun interfaces to so many languages but which language
and shogun interface should I use?
A: That depends a lot on your taste. I personally consider the modular
interfaces (python_modular, octave_modular) to be "best". Here best means very
flexible and easily extensible. However, in case you just want to train a single
SVM with a single or multiple kernels all of the static interfaces are
sufficient. And well, of course you should be using \b python http://www.python.org :-)

\li: Q: I've found a bug, where should I report it?
A: Either report it in our bug tracker http://trac.tuebingen.mpg.de/shogun or
ask on the mailinglist.

\li Q:Do I need CPLEX to use multiple kernel learning?
A: No, as of version 0.7.0 you won't need cplex if you want to learn the weights
in front of the kernels. However, to enable Multiple %Kernel Learning \b with
CPLEX(tm) just make sure cplex can be found in the PATH.  For standard 1-norm
multiple kernel learning (MKL) the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) version at
least 4.29 or CPLEX is required. For general p-norm MKL with p>1 it will work
nonetheless.

\li: Q: Is it multiple kernel learning when I use many kernels?
A: No, a plain combination of features/kernels will remain a plain
concatenation. Only in case you learn the kernel weights you really do MKL. In
the static interfaces you can issue \verbatim [W]=sg('get_subkernel_weights') \endverbatim
and check whether all weights W are still 1.0.

\li Q:Why does shogun not compile under windows?
A: It requires cygwin and the dependencies need to be compiled manually. As none
one of us use windows, and things (in external dependencies) break frequently,
feel free to submit patches. If your are looking for a win32 port, there is
none, but we take patches :-)

\li Q:How does shogun do its memory management?
A: As does python, we use reference counting internally, i.e. objects holding a
reference to another object should increase the reference count of the object
they are referencing and decrease the counter when they finished using the
object. It should be noted that loops (e.g., object A holding a reference to object B
and vice versa) are not detecting and may thus create memory leaks. However,
this scenario can so far be easily avoided - just don't create a combined
kernel that contains itself as a subkernel ;-)
